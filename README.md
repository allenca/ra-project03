I understand in a more abstract way when we learn these concepts in tutorials, but face difficulty when applying that lesson to building this web app. Currently unable to populate the data that was retrieved from the server in an owl carousel, despite asking and getting help from others, and looking up how to set it up in angular myself.  

I focused more on the functionality of the project compared to Project 2, and so the web app lacks much of the content and styling that it should have.

Some things I realized I need to improve, are my understanding of using Angular, time management, organization of files. This project marked my first attempt to use Angular and Angular CLI. I used terminal a lot more to deal with commit errors compared to previous projects. I used more time than I did on Project 2 to work, but did not get nearly as far. This is an important concern that I will need to address but getting a better theoretical understanding of how components and services work, and how to build them. 

I will need to come back to this project to finish the functionality, styling, and code in general before portfolio week, but after finishing the work on Project 2 Shopping Cart.
